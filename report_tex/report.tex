\section*{Testing CXFEL Code with Multiple Dataset}
\subsection*{2BUK Imaging - Done}
Calculated squared distances between snapshots and projected onto diffusion map manifolds.

\subsection*{CroV Imaging - Done}
\noindent Applied mask and down sampled the raw data.

\noindent Calculated squared distances between snapshots and projected onto diffusion map manifolds.

\noindent Resorted along with the increasing order of first eigen values.

\noindent Using SnA method to calculate squared distance and dot product to get ATA.

\noindent Reconstructed two modes of topos and chronos.

\noindent Tested above process in both single node and MPI.

\noindent \textcolor{red}{Need to double check the results, i.e. chronos, to make this a benchmark to evaluate further test in the future}

\subsection*{PYP Crystallography - Ongoing}
Using SnA method to caluclate squared distance

Read raw data into an NxD matrix - Done

Using SnA or SnA MPI function to write square or pipe block files - Done

\begin{adjustwidth}{\parindent}{}
Concatenate pipe files - Errors: Using numpy to initiate a 70Kx70K 2D array exceeds memory limits. Trying float16 datatype when Mortimer is back to normal.
\end{adjustwidth}

\textcolor{red}{\st{Change data types can reduce size by $4$ at most, from double to half.}}

\textcolor{red}{\st{Cut whole sqDist distance before sparcify can work, tested with loop and CroV dataset.}}

\textcolor{red}{\st{Mortimer is back! But some environments has changed, still learning like how to activate conda, install VScode etc.}}


\noindent Using SnA method to calculate dot product

\noindent Find ATA and extract chronos

\noindent With octave calling all python libraries, the code can run without bugs, but the result chrono seems off. Need to look into the transition between matlab and python code.

\subsection*{GUI design - Ongoing}
\textcolor{red}{A first version of quick and dirty GUI is done for diffusion map, details are going to be discussed.}

\section*{Research Projects with Existing Code}
\subsection*{Data Incompleteness/Partiallity with NLSA Method}
Ongoing
